## 1.6.1

Fix for [issue](https://github.com/781flyingdutchman/background_downloader/issues/6) with 
Firebase plugin `onMethodCall` handler

## 1.6.0

Added option to set `requiresWiFi` on the `BackgroundDownloadTask`, which ensures the task won't
start downloading unless a WiFi network is available. By default `requiresWiFi` is false, and 
downloads will use the cellular (or metered) network if WiFi is not available, which may incur
cost.

## 1.5.0

Added `allTasks` method to get a list of running tasks. Use `allTaskIds` to get a list of taskIds
only.

## 1.4.2

Added note to README referring to an issue (
and [fix](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/issues/9689#issuecomment-1304491789)) where the
firebase plugin interferes with the downloader

## 1.4.1

Improved example app, updated documentation and fixed minor Android bug

## 1.4.0

Added `downloadBatch` method to enqueue and wait for completion of a batch of downloads

## 1.3.0

Added option to use an event listener instead of (or in addition to) callbacks

## 1.2.0

Added FileDownloader.download as a convenience method for simple downloads. This method's Future
completes only after the download has completed or failed, and can be used for simple downloads
where status and progress checking is not required.

## 1.1.0

Added headers and metaData fields to the BackgroundDownloadTask. Headers will be added to the
request, and metaData is ignored but may be helpful to the user

## 1.0.2

Replaced Ktor client with a basic Kotlin implementation

## 1.0.0

Initial release
